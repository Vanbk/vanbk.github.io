## Abstract
KAIST Indoor Localization System (KAILOS) was introduced in 2014 and became one of the world-first complete indoor positioning solutions. It is mainly based on the WiFi signal to estimate location and provide positioning service via mobile application that has many restrictions by the Operating System. This study proposes an extended architecture of KAILOS to make use of the IoT device for removing the barriers of the mobile-app-based approach and conveniently providing indoor positioning service. Design of the IoT device that contains hardware and software is also presented. Via this study, we prove that the IoT-based approach is promising and can be a crucial feature to widen applications of indoor localization services.
